   @Summary
     This is the generated driver implementation file for the NCO1 driver using PIC10 / PIC12 / PIC16 / PIC18 MCUs
 
   @Description
     This source file provides implementations for driver APIs for NCO1.
     Generation Information :

	 Device            :  PIC18F47Q84
	 Driver Version    :  2.11
     The generated drivers are tested against the following:
	 Compiler          :  XC8 2.36 and above or later
	 MPLAB             :  MPLAB X 6.00
